    "text": "This comes from the file data.qmd.\nYour first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.\nI recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

    "text": "Where to keep data?\nBelow 50mb: In dataset folder\nAbove 50mb: In dataset-ignore folder which you will have to create manually. This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.\nWhy was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don’t know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.\n\nDescribe the different data files used and what each variable means.\n\nIf you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones, possibly grouping together variables that are similar, and summarize the rest.\nUse figures or tables to help explain the data. For example, showing a histogram or bar chart for a particularly important variable can provide a quick overview of the values that variable tends to take.\n\nDescribe any cleaning you had to do for your data.\n\nYou must include a link to your clean_data.R file.\nRename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.\nAlso, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.\nDescribe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.\nSome repetition of what you do in your clean_data.R file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.\n\nOrganization, clarity, cleanliness of the page\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained."

    "text": "In our ongoing exploration of the data, we have identified several clear trends, such as the variation in bullying rates across states for different demographic groups. One question we want to address next is whether these trends are primarily driven by the prevalence of certain racial, religious, or gender groups within each state, or whether other underlying factors also play significant roles. We plan to normalize reported harassment rates by each group’s population size in that state, thereby distinguishing true disparities from simple differences in group size. We also intend to create side-by-side visualizations comparing bullying incidents with school support resources—like security personnel, counselors, and social workers—to see if and how these resources might affect bullying outcomes.\nWe will try to compare staffing ratios: calculate ratios such as the number of students per counselor or security guard and visualize differences in resource allocation using bar charts or heat maps (highlight states with high rates of bullying and inadequate allocation of support staff).\nLinking bullying to support staff. We sought to analyze the association between the presence of different types of support staff(counselors, security guards, nurses, etc) and reported rates of bullying. For example, we believe that schools with more counselors had lower rates of bullying, showing that counseling efforts are effective in preventing such incidents. To begin approaching this comparison, we created a state-level chart showing the average number of harassment allegations per school. This visualization allows us to normalize incident counts across states and better compare the burden faced by individual schools. States like Utah, Illinois, and Washington stand out with significantly higher per-school allegations. This chart sets the stage for deeper analysis, where we plan to examine whether such rates correlate with a lack (or presence) of specific support staff. Drawing these connections may help identify which staffing patterns are most effective at reducing incidents.\nAs for modeling, we are considering a logistic regression approach that treats bullying incidents as the outcome variable, incorporating demographic proportions, resource availability, and potential interactions as predictors. We may also explore more flexible methods—such as random forests—if we suspect more complex or nonlinear relationships. In the coming week, our goal is to finalize which transformations are necessary, experiment with different model types, and assess model performance. By doing so, we hope to gain a clearer picture of which factors truly drive the observed patterns and how schools might leverage this information to improve student well-being. Below is graph the Heat map for total number of harassment by states(We’ll do the same for staff ratio after collecting data of total number of students in each school)"

After cleaning (removing negative values, summing rows, and normalizing counts), we calculated the number of allegations per 100 students for each school and then aggregated them to the state level.\nThe goal was to create normalized state-level comparisons to account for differences in population size.\n\n2.1 Challenges\nWhile the join between the datasets was successful, we encountered a few key issues:\n\nSome SCHIDs existed in the enrollment file but not in the allegations file (and vice versa).\nStates such as Montana, Idaho, and Nevada were initially missing from maps due to unmatched or filtered out data.\nWe needed to perform a left_join instead of an inner_join to preserve all schools and treat missing allegations as zeros.\n\nWe resolved this by carefully tracking which states and schools were being dropped and ensuring a complete join structure by using replace_na()."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Data Background\nThe Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data we chose comes from public schools and school districts across the United States, collected by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). It is gathered to monitor educational access and equity, ensuring compliance with federal civil rights laws. The data is publicly available on the CRDCwebsite, allowing access to the original source. However, potential issues include self-reported data inaccuracies, missing responses, and reporting inconsistencies across districts. The sample population includes all U.S. public schools, but biases may arise from underreporting, data misclassification, or non-standardized responses. This data is widely used for research on disparities in school discipline, advanced coursework access, and special education services, informing policy decisions on educational equity and civil rights enforcement. Several studies have examined this data to analyze racial disparities, resource allocation, and systemic inequalities, raising questions about data reliability, completeness, and the effectiveness of civil rights enforcement based on these reports.\nData Loading and Cleaning\nWe cleaned the dataset that the column name has “SCH_”by removing SCH_H from all the columns and pushed it onto Github. Also, since the column names aren’t intuitive, we want to use the appendix and column definitions provided in it, to create some pattern or new way of naming columns so they’re easier to understand. We added a “cleaned.dataset.ds” into the dataset file.\nWe are going to remove the missing values for the following criteria. \nThere are 6710 rows in the dataset that contain any of the specified reserve code values (-3,-4,-5,-6,-9,-12,-13).\nData for Equity\nWhen analyzing the Harassment and Bullying dataset, it is essential to uphold equity principles to ensure responsible and ethical data use. Transparency and accountability require clearly documenting data sources, acknowledging limitations, and preventing misrepresentation. Contextualization and responsible communication emphasize understanding differences in reporting practices across schools to avoid misleading comparisons. Lastly, avoiding harm and misuse means disaggregating data thoughtfully to highlight disparities without reinforcing stereotypes and ensuring findings support positive, data-driven interventions rather than punitive measures. By applying these principles, we can produce insights that are fair, meaningful, and beneficial for educators, policymakers, and students."

    "text": "Original Data Source:\nThe datasets that we have chosen are Suspensions, School Support, and Harassment & Bullying. The datasets originate from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) from the year 2021-2022, accessible at civilrightsdata.ed.gov. The CRDC collects information from public schools and school districts across the United States to monitor civil rights compliance and ensure equal educational opportunities.\nDataset 1: Suspensions.csv\nThis dataset specifically focuses on school suspensions, capturing disciplinary actions reported by various educational institutions. The data includes key identifiers such as state, district, and school names, along with detailed metrics on suspension incidents, disciplinary actions for students under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), and total days missed due to suspensions. The dataset is structured with 98,010 rows and 189 columns, indicating a vast amount of data covering multiple years and educational jurisdictions.\nThe data was originally collected for federal reporting and policy-making to identify disparities in disciplinary actions across different demographics, such as race, gender, and disability status. Schools are required to report disciplinary statistics to the CRDC, which is then used to inform research, educational reforms, and civil rights enforcement. However, challenges arise due to missing or inconsistent values, such as placeholder values like -9, which indicate missing or N/A data. Additionally, some columns contain mixed data types, requiring standardization for proper analysis. The primary questions that can be explored with this dataset include: which states or districts have the highest suspension rates, and whether certain demographic groups face disproportionate disciplinary actions. The size and complexity of the dataset make it essential to clean and preprocess the data before drawing meaningful conclusions. Potential challenges include handling data inconsistencies, ensuring comparability across districts, and dealing with missing or erroneous records.\nDataset 2: School_Support.csv\nThis dataset includes a total of 19 columns across 98010 entries. It provides an overview of the staffing resources in schools in each state of the United States, including security personnel, teaching fellows (both certified and uncertified), and various support services such as counselors, nurses, psychologists, and social workers. The data includes specific schools and justice agencies, indicating that diverse educational environments have different educational support structures. Some columns (such as TOT_TEACHERS_CURR_M and TOT_TEACHERS_CURR_F) contain negative values, which indicates missing data or recording errors. The number of resources and personnel allocated to school highlights the support and help provided by different agencies and organizations to students and also shows the attention and emphasis on specialized educational environments. Some questions that we can come up with using this dataset include: How does the staffing of school security personnel vary across states and regions? What is the ratio of counselors, nurses, and psychologists to students in different schools? Does school resource allocation vary by location or regional funding level?\nDataset 3: Harassment_and_Bullying.csv\nThis dataset primarily focuses on harassment and bullying incidents reported in educational institutions,capturing various forms of misconduct and disciplinary actions. It includeskey variables such as state, district, school names, student demographics and so on. The dataset contains 98,010 rows and 159 columns, making it a large dataset with detailed information on bullying and harassment incidents in schools across different states.\nThe dataset is coming from CRDC, it gathers key civil rights metrics to assess access to and obstacles in educational opportunities from early childhood through grade 12. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) utilizes this data from public school districts to investigate discrimination complaints, evaluate compliance with federal civil rights laws, conduct proactive reviews, and offer policy guidance and technical support to schools and districts.\nPotential areas of investigation include identifying regions with the highest bullying reports, examining patterns of disciplinary actions, and evaluating disparities among student groups.\nThe biggest challenge for this dataset is to organize and clean the format of it, as The dataset is structured in a wide format, where multiple columns represent similar variables. Also, there are many columns containing only 0s, indicating that some schools never reported incidents"

You don’t need a formal citation.\nIf you are directly quoting from a source, please make that clear. You can show long quotes using &gt; like this\n&gt; To be or not to be.\n\nTo be or not to be."

This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.\n\nModeling and Inference\n\nThe page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.\nExplain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)\nDescribe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.\n\nExplain the flaws and limitations of your analysis\n\nAre there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?\n\nClarity Figures\n\nAre your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?\nEach figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)\nDefault lm output and plots are typically not acceptable.\n\nClarity of Explanations\n\nHow well do you explain each figure/result?\nDo you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?\n\nOrganization and cleanliness.\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, hide all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data."

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a how a news article or a magazine story might draw you in. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
