A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

    "text": "Where to keep data?\nBelow 50mb: In dataset folder\nAbove 50mb: In dataset-ignore folder which you will have to create manually. This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

Show me only what is important and relevant.\nCleaning must be entirely in R\nDon’t say things like, well if only everyone did like so and so than everything would be better.

The main pages should focus on the data and your findings.\n\n\nUse the tidyverse!\nNo but seriously, when asking ChatGPT to do your project for you, make sure to tell it to use the tidyverse, not base R."

    "text": "Data Background\nThe Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data we chose comes from public schools and school districts across the United States, collected by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). It is gathered to monitor educational access and equity, ensuring compliance with federal civil rights laws. The data is publicly available on the CRDCwebsite, allowing access to the original source. However, potential issues include self-reported data inaccuracies, missing responses, and reporting inconsistencies across districts. The sample population includes all U.S. public schools, but biases may arise from underreporting, data misclassification, or non-standardized responses. This data is widely used for research on disparities in school discipline, advanced coursework access, and special education services, informing policy decisions on educational equity and civil rights enforcement. Several studies have examined this data to analyze racial disparities, resource allocation, and systemic inequalities, raising questions about data reliability, completeness, and the effectiveness of civil rights enforcement based on these reports.\nData Loading and Cleaning\nWe cleaned the dataset that the column name has “SCH_”by removing SCH_H from all the columns and pushed it onto Github. Also, since the column names aren’t intuitive, we want to use the appendix and column definitions provided in it, to create some pattern or new way of naming columns so they’re easier to understand. We added a “cleaned.dataset.ds” into the dataset file.\nWe are going to remove the missing values for the following criteria. \nThere are 6710 rows in the dataset that contain any of the specified reserve code values (-3,-4,-5,-6,-9,-12,-13).\nData for Equity\nWhen analyzing the Harassment and Bullying dataset, it is essential to uphold equity principles to ensure responsible and ethical data use. Transparency and accountability require clearly documenting data sources, acknowledging limitations, and preventing misrepresentation. Contextualization and responsible communication emphasize understanding differences in reporting practices across schools to avoid misleading comparisons. Lastly, avoiding harm and misuse means disaggregating data thoughtfully to highlight disparities without reinforcing stereotypes and ensuring findings support positive, data-driven interventions rather than punitive measures. By applying these principles, we can produce insights that are fair, meaningful, and beneficial for educators, policymakers, and students."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Original Data Source:\nThe datasets that we have chosen are Suspensions, School Support, and Harassment & Bullying. The datasets originate from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) from the year 2021-2022, accessible at civilrightsdata.ed.gov. The CRDC collects information from public schools and school districts across the United States to monitor civil rights compliance and ensure equal educational opportunities.\nDataset 1: Suspensions.csv\nThis dataset specifically focuses on school suspensions, capturing disciplinary actions reported by various educational institutions. The data includes key identifiers such as state, district, and school names, along with detailed metrics on suspension incidents, disciplinary actions for students under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), and total days missed due to suspensions. The dataset is structured with 98,010 rows and 189 columns, indicating a vast amount of data covering multiple years and educational jurisdictions.\nThe data was originally collected for federal reporting and policy-making to identify disparities in disciplinary actions across different demographics, such as race, gender, and disability status. Schools are required to report disciplinary statistics to the CRDC, which is then used to inform research, educational reforms, and civil rights enforcement. However, challenges arise due to missing or inconsistent values, such as placeholder values like -9, which indicate missing or N/A data. Additionally, some columns contain mixed data types, requiring standardization for proper analysis. The primary questions that can be explored with this dataset include: which states or districts have the highest suspension rates, and whether certain demographic groups face disproportionate disciplinary actions. The size and complexity of the dataset make it essential to clean and preprocess the data before drawing meaningful conclusions. Potential challenges include handling data inconsistencies, ensuring comparability across districts, and dealing with missing or erroneous records.\nDataset 2: School_Support.csv\nThis dataset includes a total of 19 columns across 98010 entries. It provides an overview of the staffing resources in schools in each state of the United States, including security personnel, teaching fellows (both certified and uncertified), and various support services such as counselors, nurses, psychologists, and social workers. The data includes specific schools and justice agencies, indicating that diverse educational environments have different educational support structures. Some columns (such as TOT_TEACHERS_CURR_M and TOT_TEACHERS_CURR_F) contain negative values, which indicates missing data or recording errors. The number of resources and personnel allocated to school highlights the support and help provided by different agencies and organizations to students and also shows the attention and emphasis on specialized educational environments. Some questions that we can come up with using this dataset include: How does the staffing of school security personnel vary across states and regions? What is the ratio of counselors, nurses, and psychologists to students in different schools? Does school resource allocation vary by location or regional funding level?\nDataset 3: Harassment_and_Bullying.csv\nThis dataset primarily focuses on harassment and bullying incidents reported in educational institutions,capturing various forms of misconduct and disciplinary actions. It includeskey variables such as state, district, school names, student demographics and so on. The dataset contains 98,010 rows and 159 columns, making it a large dataset with detailed information on bullying and harassment incidents in schools across different states.\nThe dataset is coming from CRDC, it gathers key civil rights metrics to assess access to and obstacles in educational opportunities from early childhood through grade 12. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) utilizes this data from public school districts to investigate discrimination complaints, evaluate compliance with federal civil rights laws, conduct proactive reviews, and offer policy guidance and technical support to schools and districts.\nPotential areas of investigation include identifying regions with the highest bullying reports, examining patterns of disciplinary actions, and evaluating disparities among student groups.\nThe biggest challenge for this dataset is to organize and clean the format of it, as The dataset is structured in a wide format, where multiple columns represent similar variables. Also, there are many columns containing only 0s, indicating that some schools never reported incidents"
