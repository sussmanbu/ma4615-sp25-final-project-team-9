# Motivation for Data Analysis

Our project aims to understand the complex factors influencing
harassment, and bullying incidents across public schools in the United
States. We start off our analysis on a high-level view of harassment and
bullying nationally, but end up particularly focusing on how
school-level resources (counselors, psychologists, security staff),
student demographics, and geographic location contribute to reported
incidents.

Given persistent racial, disability-related, and orientation-based
disparities, our goal is to identify actionable patterns that can inform
equity-focused educational reforms.

# Research Questions

-   Do schools with more support staff report fewer harassment
    incidents?
-   How does harassment rate vary across different identity categories
    (e.g., race, disability, religion, sexual orientation)?
-   Are geographic patterns evident - do some states or regions report
    higher normalized rates?

# Exploration

One of the most pressing concerns that led us to analyze this data was
to understand the groups (based on race, disability, religion, sexual
orientation, etc.) that were most affected nationwide.

# National-Level View

![Normalized rate of harassment allegations based on sexual orientation
across U.S. states](images/sex_orientation.png)

This map shows the normalized rate of allegations based on sexual
orientation. Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey all had high rates
with closer to 10%. The northwest region showed very few or no reported
cases.

![Normalized rate of harassment allegations based on religion across
U.S. states](images/religion.png)

This map highlights religion-based harassment allegations. While overall
rates were lower compared to other categories, Massachusetts again
stands out. States like Utah and Idaho had zero or near-zero cases.

![Normalized rate of harassment allegations based on race across U.S.
states](images/race.png)

This map displays allegations of harassment due to race, color, or
national origin. Massachusetts once again leads with the highest number
of allegations, followed closely by New York and California. The
southeast and parts of the northwest had lower reported rates. However,
these graphs fail to provide an accurate representation of the number of
allegations within each of these categories (race, religion, sex) as
this is only depicting the reported incidents. Unreported incidents
likely in the northwestern states are not depicted in the data itself so
we fail to make appropriate inferences and comparisons between the
states themselves.

-   Slope (β1): β1=−0.352, it indicates that a 1% increase in total
    support staff is associated with a 0.352% decrease in harassment
    allegations per 100 students. This negative elasticity suggests that
    more support staff correlates with fewer reported incidents.

-   Intercept (β0): This represents the expected log of allegations per
    100 students when the log of total support staff is zero.

-   R\^2 = 0.08 : This means that approximately 8% of the variability in
    harassment allegations per 100 students is explained by the model.
    While the relationship is statistically significant, other factors
    not included in the model likely influence the number of
    allegations.

```{r echo=FALSE}

#Model Evaluation
model <- lm(log(allegations_per_100) ~ log(total_support), data = data)

model_stats <- glance(model) %>%
  transmute(
    `R-squared` = r.squared,
    `Adjusted R-squared` = adj.r.squared,
    Sigma = sigma,
    `F-statistic` = statistic,
    `p-value` = p.value,
    `Degrees of Freedom` = df
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value")

kable(model_stats, caption = "Model Fit Statistics Table")
```

The linear regression model reveals a statistically significant
relationship between log total school support staff and log harassment
allegations per 100 students. With an R-squared of 0.0805, the model
explains approximately 8% of the variation in the outcome, suggesting a
modest explanatory power. The adjusted R-squared is nearly identical,
indicating that the model is not overfitting despite its simplicity. The
F-statistic is high (1742.04) with a p-value effectively zero,
confirming that the predictor contributes meaningfully to explaining
variation in the response variable. The residual standard error (sigma)
is about 1.05 on the log scale, indicating the typical prediction error.
Overall, while the model is statistically strong, its predictive power
is limited, highlighting the need for additional explanatory variables
to better understand harassment reports in schools.

```{r echo=FALSE}

#Redisual VS Fitted
model_diag <- augment(model)
# Plot using ggplot

  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +

    x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
    y = "Sample Quantiles"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Our model residuals are mostly normal, especially in the center, which
is reassuring for coefficient inference. But the tail deviations suggest
the presence of outliers or non-normality in extreme values. Thus,
Inferences involving prediction intervals or extreme outcomes may be
less reliable. Therefore, though the model appears reasonable in form,
but the presence of heteroskedasticity suggests we might consider using
robust standard errors when reporting p-values and confidence intervals.

## Trends and Correlations

-   AM (Red): Shows a weak and slightly negative correlation between
    school support and harassment rates. Increased support does not
    significantly change allegations among American Indian/Alaska Native
    students.
-   AS (Brown): Displays a slight negative correlation. Allegation rates
    decrease with more support, though the relationship is not
    statistically strong.
-   BL (Green): Shows a modest downward trend, suggesting that increased
    support staff may be linked to lower harassment allegations among
    Black students, though with considerable variability.
-   HI (Teal): Exhibits a clearer negative correlation. Schools with
    higher support tend to report fewer harassment cases involving
    Hispanic students.
-   HP (Light Blue): Shows a near-flat to slightly positive slope. This
    group reports higher baseline harassment rates, and increased
    support staff does not appear to lower the rate significantly.
-   TR (Purple): Displays a moderately negative trend, implying a
    potential benefit of school support staff in reducing harassment
    against multiracial students.
-   WH (Pink): Has one of the steepest negative slopes. Greater support
    staff presence is strongly associated with fewer allegations among
    White students.

Across racial groups, schools with greater staff support — including
counselors, psychologists, and security, tend to report fewer race-based
harassment allegations per 100 students. This trend suggests that
investments in support personnel may contribute to safer, more inclusive
school environments, particularly for groups like White, Hispanic, and
Multiracial students. However, the impact is not uniform, and further
investigation may be needed for groups such as Native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islanders, who experience high baseline rates and limited benefit from
staffing increases.

```

Regardless of the missing data across multiple states, we noticed that
Massachusetts had a lot of data, and also had the highest proportion of
allegations compared to all states. Therefore, from these observations,
we narrowed our focus down to the state of Massachusetts, and identified
key trends in relation to school support resources (counselors,
psychologists, security), and demographics.

This log-log regression focuses on schools in Massachusetts and shows a
modest negative association between school support staffing and
harassment allegations per 100 students. The downward slope (𝑦 = −0.376
− 0.325𝑥, 𝑅² = 0.08) suggests that schools with more counselors,
psychologists, and security staff tend to report fewer harassment
incidents, though the relationship is relatively weak. Still, the trend
aligns with our broader hypothesis that greater support infrastructure
may help create safer school environments.

```

The first graph shows that schools in Massachusetts with the lowest
levels of school support staff tend to serve predominantly Black and
Hispanic student populations, with very low proportions of White or
Asian students. In contrast, the second graph reveals that schools with
the highest levels of support staff exhibit more racial diversity, with
some having a significantly higher proportion of White and Asian
students. This contrast suggests a potential equity gap, where schools
serving more students of color have less access to support resources.

# Conclusion

Our analysis finds that schools with more support staff (counselors,
psychologists, and security) tend to report slightly fewer harassment
incidents, particularly in Massachusetts, although the effect is modest.
Racial disparities are also evident: schools with high proportions of
non-White students often have fewer support resources, raising equity
concerns. While increased staffing is weakly correlated with improved
outcomes, this analysis highlights the importance of targeted,
equity-focused interventions to address harassment and disciplinary
disparities across student demographics.

# Challenges and Limitations

One key limitation is the underreporting of incidents, particularly in
states with low reported rates (e.g., northwestern states), which may
skew comparisons. Additionally, the data only reflects documented cases,
leaving gaps in understanding the full scope of harassment and bullying.
Another challenge is the lack of granularity in school-level resource
allocation, making it difficult to directly correlate support staff
presence with incident rates. Finally, demographic disparities in
reporting (e.g., male vs. female reports) may introduce bias in
interpreting which groups are most affected.
