## Introduction

**SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL**: The foundational promise that schools are not only places of learning but also safe, inclusive environments where all students can thrive‚Äîregardless of race, disability, gender identity, or background.
And yet, each year, thousands of students report experiencing bullying, harassment, and exclusion‚Äîoften along lines of race, ability, or orientation.
These are not isolated incidents, but part of a broader pattern that raises difficult questions: Why are some students disproportionately affected?
What role does school infrastructure play?
And perhaps most urgently‚Äîwhat can be done to disrupt this cycle?

We must ask ourselves: Is every student truly safe at school?
Are disciplinary measures addressing harm, or reinforcing inequality?
And how do support resources‚Äîor the lack thereof‚Äîshape these outcomes?

###Why is Analyzing Harassment and School Support Data Important?

Analyzing public school data on harassment, bullying, and suspensions offers a critical lens into how educational environments succeed‚Äîor fail‚Äîto protect their most vulnerable students.
By investigating the presence of school counselors, psychologists, and security staff alongside demographic and geographic variables, we can begin to identify patterns of disparity.
Do more counselors correlate with fewer incidents?
Are certain students more likely to be punished than protected?

This analysis helps uncover whether school resources are distributed equitably and whether their presence meaningfully impacts student safety and discipline outcomes.
In doing so, we aim to contribute to a broader conversation about educational equity, institutional accountability, and the urgent need for reform.

## Thesis

**The Support Gap**: Examining the Link Between School Resources and Race-Based Harassment in U.S.
Schools Racially-based harassment in U.S. schools remains persistently high across all states, highlighting a nationwide equity challenge in educational environments.
However, our analysis reveals a consistent inverse relationship between the level of school-based support‚Äîsuch as counselors, psychologists, and security staff‚Äîand the frequency of race-related harassment incidents.
These findings suggest that strengthening student support infrastructure may play a critical role in reducing race-based harassment and fostering safer, more inclusive learning environments.

## From a National Lens to a Massachusetts Focus

Using data from the Civil Rights Data Collection (2021‚Äì2022), we observed that:

-   Harassment rates vary sharply by **identity and geography**
-   **Massachusetts** had the **highest normalized rate** of harassment allegations by race, religion, and orientation
-   Students of color, especially **Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic students**, experience higher harassment per 100 students

These trends pushed us to zoom in on Massachusetts for a closer, state-level look.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Is There a Link Between Staff and Safety?

We modeled harassment reports per 100 students against school support staffing using a log-log regression:

``` text
log(harassment) = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó log(total_staff)
```

üìâ **Key Result**:\
A 1% increase in support staff is associated with a **0.35% decrease** in race-based harassment rates (Œ≤‚ÇÅ = -0.352, R¬≤ = 0.08)

But the link is modest‚Äîand not all students benefit equally.

## Rubric: Other components

### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository.
You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.

### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/descr iption/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
