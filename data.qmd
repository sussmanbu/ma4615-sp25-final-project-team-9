## Source

The data is publicly available on the [CRDC website](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/), allowing access to the original source.

## Describe where/how to find data

All of our three raw datasets are coming from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). It includes public schools and school districts across the United States, collected by the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

It is used to monitor educational access and equity, ensuring compliance with federal civil rights laws. The datasets originate from the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) from the year 2021-2022, accessible at [civilrightsdata.ed.gov](https://civilrightsdata.ed.gov/data).

## Data Source

### Data Set 1: Harassment and Bullying

Description:

This dataset primarily focuses on harassment and bullying incidents reported in educational institutions, capturing various forms of misconduct and disciplinary actions. It includes key variables such as state, district, school names, student demographics and so on.It gathers key civil rights metrics to assess access to and obstacles in educational opportunities from early childhood through grade 12. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) utilizes this data from public school districts to investigate discrimination complaints, evaluate compliance with federal civil rights laws, conduct proactive reviews, and offer policy guidance and technical support to schools and districts.

### Data Set 2: School Support

Description The school support dataset contains information on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) counselors, psychologists, and security guards at individual schools. After removing negative and missing values, we found that most schools have very few support staff, with distributions heavily skewed toward zero. While the majority of schools report no psychologists or guards, a small number of schools report larger support teams. The presence of a few schools with unusually high staff numbers indicates variation likely related to school size or reporting differences.

| Variable        | Description                     | Data Type |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| FTECOUNSELORS   | Number of FTE school counselors | Decimal   |
| FTESERVICES_PSY | Number of FTE psychologists     | Decimal   |
| FTESECURITY_GUA | Number of FTE security guards   | Decimal   |

#### Findings about key variables

```{r echo = FALSE}
school_support_data <- read_csv("dataset/School Support.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Clean: Only remove negatives and NA
school_support_clean <- school_support_data %>%
  select(
    counselors = SCH_FTECOUNSELORS,
    psychologists = SCH_FTESERVICES_PSY,
    security_guards = SCH_FTESECURITY_GUA
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    counselors = ifelse(counselors < 0 , NA, counselors),
    psychologists = ifelse(psychologists < 0 , NA, psychologists),
    security_guards = ifelse(security_guards < 0 , NA, security_guards)
  )

summary(school_support_clean)

# Key Statistics
summary_table <- school_support_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    missing = sum(is.na(value)),
    mean = round(mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    median = round(median(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    sd = round(sd(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    min = round(min(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    max = round(max(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  )

print(summary_table)

cat("Counselors are more consistently present across schools.
    Psychologists and especially security guards are much less common, with higher proportions of zeros and missing entries.
    The high standard deviations relative to means for all three suggest substantial variability across school sizes or resource allocations.")
```

### Data Set 3: School Enrollment

Reason to use this dataset: The Enrollment dataset contains detailed counts of student populations across multiple racial and ethnic groups at the school level.It breaks down enrollment into male and female students across 7 racial categories: Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Black, White, and Two or More Races.This data is crucial for accurately normalizing harassment report counts by providing the total population against which allegations are measured, enabling fair comparison across institutions of varying sizes and demographics. If we only compare raw counts of harassment reports, larger schools will naturally have more reports just because they have more students.By dividing number of harassment reports by total enrollment, we calculate harassment allegations per 100 students, which normalizes across schools of different sizes.

| Variable | Description                                                |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ENR_HI_M | Number of Hispanic Male Students                           |
| ENR_HI_F | Number of Hispanic Female Students                         |
| ENR_AM_M | Number of American Indian/Alaska Native Male Students      |
| ENR_AM_F | Number of American Indian/Alaska Native Female Students    |
| ENR_AS_M | Number of Asian Male Students                              |

## Merge and Clean Data Process

[data_clean_process.qmd](/scripts/data_clean_process.qmd)

[data_clean_process.R](/scripts/data_clean_process.R)


This project involved merging and cleaning multiple datasets related to school enrollment, harassment reports, and school support services. In the original dataset, several variables contained reserved codes represented by negative values. These codes are not actual data values but rather placeholders for missing, suppressed, or logic-dependent responses. The specific reserve codes and their meanings are:

| Reserve Code Value | Definition                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| -3                 | Skip Logic or Processing Failure   |
| -4                 | Missing Optional Data              |
| -5                 | Action Plan/Quick Plans            |
| -6                 | Force Certified                    |
| -9                 | Not Applicable/Skipped             |
| -12                | Suppressed for Privacy Protections |
| -13                | Missing DIND Skip Logic            |

To ensure accurate analysis, these values were converted to `NA`, as they do not represent valid quantitative information. Including them would lead to misleading statistics and incorrect interpretations in visualizations and summaries.

The overall script includes:

\- Reading raw datasets from the `dataset/` directory

\- Replacing reserved codes (e.g. -3, -4, -6, etc.) with `NA`

\- Removing invalid or fully-missing rows

\- Renaming variables for clarity (e.g., removing `SCH_` prefix)

\- Merging harassment, enrollment, and support data into a single cleaned dataset - Saving the output as `.rds` and `.csv` files
