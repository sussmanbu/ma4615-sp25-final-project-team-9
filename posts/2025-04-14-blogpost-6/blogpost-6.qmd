## Correlate with School Support Data

### Do schools with more counselors, social workers, or psychologists have fewer allegations?

We conducted a **log-transformed linear regression** to explore this question. Key results are visualized below:

![Correlation of Staff and Allegations](correlation.png)

Only `SCH_FTECOUNSELORS` showed a significant effect — **but in the opposite direction** than expected. Each additional counselor is associated with a **9.86% increase** in the reported harassment & bullying rate per 100 students (on a log scale).

Psychologists and security guards did not show statistically significant effects.

> This unexpected result might be due to **heteroscedasticity**, as shown in the QQ-plot below:

## Compare Demographics

### Are schools with higher percentages of vulnerable student groups (e.g., LGBTQ+, students with disabilities, etc.) more likely to have higher rates?

![Disability Correlation Plot](disability.png)

-   **0.166** indicates a **weak positive association** between the percentage of students with disabilities and allegation rates.
-   **0.126** shows a similar weak association for English learners.

![Allegations vs Disability Percentage](allegations.png)

This plot shows a **positive linear trend**: as the percentage of students with disabilities increases, the allegations per 100 students also tend to increase.

There is an **outlier**—two schools with very high disability percentages and very high allegation rates (nearly 100%).

### Can I normalize within demographic groups to explore equity more deeply?

Based on the above plot, we conclude that **students with disabilities may be experiencing higher rates of allegations in schools where they are a larger proportion of the population**.

## Code Summary

The core logic this week included:

-   Cleaning and transforming allegation counts\
-   Joining with total student enrollment\
-   Calculating per-100-student rates\
-   Mapping with `ggplot2` and `map_data("state")`\
-   Building a reusable function for category-specific maps
