## Introduction

This week, we worked on expanding our analysis of school-based harassment and bullying allegations. Our focus was on understanding **geographic variation** across the United States and identifying **which types of allegations are most common** in different areas when normalized for school size.

We also began the process of combining multiple datasets to deepen our analysis. Specifically, we joined together **student enrollment data** with **harassment and bullying allegations data**, using school ID (`SCHID`) as a common key.

## Datasets and Merging Process

We are combining two main datasets:

1. **Enrollment data** – which includes the number of students enrolled in each school, broken down by race, gender, and demographic categories (e.g., EL, IDEA).
2. **Harassment and bullying allegations data** – which includes counts of allegations by type (e.g., sex-based, religion-based, etc.) at the school level.

These datasets were joined using the `SCHID` column, which uniquely identifies each school. After cleaning (removing negative values, summing rows, and normalizing counts), we calculated the number of allegations **per 100 students** for each school and then aggregated them to the **state level**.

The goal was to create normalized state-level comparisons to account for differences in population size.

### Challenges

While the join between the datasets was successful, we encountered a few key issues:

- Some `SCHID`s existed in the enrollment file but not in the allegations file (and vice versa).
- States such as Montana, Idaho, and Nevada were initially missing from maps due to unmatched or filtered out data.
- We needed to perform a `left_join` instead of an `inner_join` to preserve all schools and treat missing allegations as zeros.

We resolved this by carefully tracking which states and schools were being dropped and ensuring a complete join structure by using `replace_na()`.

## Maps by Allegation Type

To investigate patterns more deeply, we created **choropleth maps** of the United States for each major category of harassment. These maps visualize the number of allegations per 100 students by state.

## Sexual Orientation-Based Allegations

This map shows the normalized rate of allegations based on sexual orientation.

- Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey all had high rates.
- The northwest region showed very few or no reported cases.

## Religion-Based Allegations

This map highlights religion-based harassment allegations.

- While overall rates were lower compared to other categories, Massachusetts again stands out.
- States like Utah and Idaho had zero or near-zero cases.

## Race/Color/National Origin Allegations

This map displays allegations of harassment due to race, color, or national origin.

- Massachusetts once again leads, followed closely by New York and California.
- The southeast and parts of the northwest had lower reported rates.

## Disability-Based Allegations

This map highlights harassment allegations reported by students with disabilities.

- Massachusetts has the highest rate, continuing the trend.
- We noticed more variation across states in this category compared to religion-based or sexual orientation-based allegations.

## Key Takeaways

From our maps, we noticed several trends:

- **Massachusetts consistently reports high normalized allegation rates across all categories.**
- **The Northwest (e.g., Montana, Idaho, Wyoming)** tends to report few or no allegations.
- Some categories like **religion-based harassment** had lower rates nationwide, potentially due to underreporting or smaller affected populations.

---

## Focusing on Massachusetts

Because Massachusetts ranks the highest across multiple allegation types, we plan to **narrow our focus to this state** in the coming weeks. This will allow us to explore trends at the **district or school level** and potentially bring in other data such as:

- Demographics (e.g., income, race/ethnicity, urban/rural classification)
- School resources (e.g., staff-to-student ratios, counselor availability)
- Community characteristics

---

## Next Steps

For the next phase of this project, we plan to:

- Further explore **school-level trends within Massachusetts**
- Investigate whether specific schools or districts are driving the state's high rates
- Look for **additional datasets** that we can combine, such as:
  - Public school performance data
  - Census-based community demographics
  - School funding or resource availability

By integrating these, we hope to better understand what underlying factors may be contributing to Massachusetts's higher rates — whether it's reporting culture, student population, or other institutional variables.
