## Blog Post 7

This week, we focused on laying the foundation for the interactive
visualizations that will be central to our final project. Our goal is to
create a **Shiny-based web app** that allows users to explore patterns
in school-based harassment and bullying allegations across the United
States, broken down by identity categories such as **sexual
orientation**, **race**, and **religion**.

While we haven‚Äôt completed the graphs yet, we‚Äôve developed the **core
logic and structure of the app** and have a clear plan for how the
interactive components will function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéØ Goals

### üåé National Map Visualization

Users will be able to: - Select an **allegation type** from a dropdown
menu (e.g., sexual orientation, race, religion) - View a **map** showing
schools across the U.S., each represented by a **circle** - Circle size
and color reflect the **number of allegations per 100 students**

### üèõ State-Level Bar Chart

Users will be able to: - Choose a **specific state** - View a **bar
chart** showing the **average rate of allegations per 100 students** in
that state - Data will be broken down by the **three main categories**
(sexual orientation, race, religion)

This provides both national and regional insights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üé® Design Intentions

We‚Äôre designing the interactive to follow key principles of effective
data visualization:

-   **Big Picture & Zoom-In:**\
    The map gives a **national overview**, while the bar chart allows
    deeper **state-level focus**

-   **Interactivity:**\
    Dropdown menus will let users **guide their own exploration** and
    switch views dynamically

-   **User Guidance:**\
    Clear **labels**, **legends**, and thoughtful layout will help users
    understand the graphs

-   **Potential for Personalization:**\
    Although not implemented yet, we‚Äôre considering allowing users to
    **search by school or district** to explore personally relevant data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöß What‚Äôs Next

-   Finish building the dropdown logic for the map and bar chart
-   Normalize allegations by school size
-   Begin experimenting with `{shinylive}` for browser-based deployment
-   Consider adding data table or district search box

Stay tuned for more updates next week!
